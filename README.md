<h3> About this course: </h3>
This is an introductory course designed to equip CogSci students with basic programming skill and its applications in experiment design, data analysis, and basic algorithms. We are going to cover the following topics:

- Programming: Data types, loops, conditionals, functions, classes/objects, modules, file handling
- Experiment design: Psychopy, JSpsych
- Data analysis and modeling: Pandas, numpy, matplotlib\
- Algorithms: Search, sort, optimization, Flask/FastAPI, Front-End UI

The content for the course will be in the form of lectures, practice scripts, and tutorials. Most of the examples and exercises in this course will focus on the applications of programming in experimental and modeling work in Cognitive Science. 

<h3> How to do this course? </h3>
I suggest the following to do this course systematically.

Don't be afraid. You can definitely learn programming even if you have never done it before. You just need a bunch of moments of confidence. This course will do that for you if you do not give up. Practice is the key.
Do not miss the lectures!
Attempt the Assignment associated with the lecture. I strongly recommend that you attempt all assignment exercises. Practice is the most important thing for doing well in this course.
When you have worked through all the lectures and assignments on a topic (e.g., Functions), attempt the automated Quiz on that topic.
